# README Document for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Scripts

This package contains two scripts, acquire_data.R and run_analysis.R.

* __acquire_data.R__ checks the directory for the data set and uploads and unzips the folder if it does not exist.
* __run_analysis.R__ does the actual cleaning and manipulation of the data set.

## Dependencies

* Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, available for download [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) (zip). The __acquire_data.R__ script will check if you have the data set and download it for you.
* R (version: 3.2.0)
* dplyr package (version: 0.4.2)

Please see the CodeBook markdown for an explanation of the script and data set.
